As the adage states: \"Time flies when you're having fun\".\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that games, toys, and activities perceived as fun are often challenging in some way. When a person is challenged to think consciously, overcome challenge and learn something new, they are more likely to enjoy a new experience and view it as fun. A change from routine activities appears to be at the core of this perception, since people spend much of a typical day engaged in activities that are routine and require limited conscious thinking. Routine information is processed by the brain as a \"chunked pattern\": \"We rarely look at the real world\", according to game designer Raph Koster, \"we instead recognize something we have chunked, and leave it at that. \\[...] One might argue that the essence of much of art is in forcing us to see things as they really are rather than as we assume them to be\". Since it helps people to relax, fun is sometimes regarded as a \"social lubricant\", important in adding \"to one's pleasure in life\" and helping to \"act as a buffer against stress\".\r\n\r\nFor children, fun is strongly related to play and they have great capacity to extract the fun from it in a spontaneous and inventive way. Play \"involves the capacity to have fun – to be able to return, at least for a little while, to never-never land and enjoy it."},{"id":1643069668,"layout":"blog\r","title":"A post on happiness\r","date":"2022-01-24 23:14:28 -0100","thumbnail":"/images/uploads/img_20220124_182725.jpg\r","content":"## Biological role of seratonine\r\n\r\nSerotonin is involved in numerous physiological processes, including sleep, thermoregulation, learning and memory, pain, (social) behavior, sex, feeding, motor activity, biological rhythms and possibly others. In less complex animals, such as some invertebrates, serotonin regulates feeding and other processes. In plants serotonin synthesis seems to be associated with stress signals.\r\n\r\n### Cellular effects\r\n\r\nSerotonin primarily acts through its receptors and its effects depend on which cells and tissues express these receptors (see below).\r\n\r\n#### Receptors\\\r\n\r\nMain article: 5-HT receptor\r\n\r\nThe 5-HT receptors, the receptors for serotonin, are located on the cell membrane of nerve cells and other cell types in animals, and mediate the effects of serotonin as the endogenous ligand and of a broad range of pharmaceutical and psychedelic drugs. Except for the 5-HT3 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel, all other 5-HT receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (also called seven-transmembrane, or heptahelical receptors) that activate an intracellular second messenger cascade."},{"id":1642192933,"layout":"blog\r","title":"Gremo kajtat z novim datumom\r","date":"2022-01-14 19:42:13 -0100","thumbnail":"/images/uploads/img_20211207_160805.jpg\r","content":"# Sex ratio\r\n\r\nMost organisms which reproduce sexually have a 1:1 sex ratio of male and female births. The English statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher outlined why this is so in what has come to be known as Fisher's principle. This essentially says the following:\r\n\r\n* 1. Suppose male births are less common than female.\r\n  2. A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.\r\n  3. Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.\r\n  4. Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.\r\n  5. As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.\r\n  6. The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio."},{"id":1640189838,"layout":"blog\r","title":"Časovno uvščen\r","date":"2021-12-22 15:17:18 -0100","thumbnail":"/images/uploads/img_20220124_182317.jpg\r","content":"# Sex in French Polinesya\r\n\r\nThe Islands have been noted for their sexual culture. Many sexual activities seen as taboo in western cultures were viewed as appropriate by the native culture. Contact with Western societies has changed many of these customs, so research into their pre-Western social history has to be done by reading antique writings.\r\n\r\nChildren slept in the same room as their parents and were able to witness their parents while they had sex. Intercourse simulation became real penetration as soon as boys were physically able. Adults found simulation of sex by children to be funny. As children approached 11 attitudes shifted toward girls. Premarital sex was not encouraged but was allowed in general, restrictions on adolescent sexuality were incest, exogamy regulations, and firstborn daughters of high-ranking lineage. After their firstborn child, high-ranking women were permitted extramarital affairs.\r\n\r\n> The next day, as soon as it was light, we were surrounded by a still greater multitude of these people. There were now a hundred females at least; and they practised all the arts of lewd expression and gesture, to gain admission on board. It was with difficulty I could get my crew to obey the orders I had given on this subject. Amongst these females were some not more than ten years of age. But youth, it seems, is here no test of innocence; these infants, as I may call them, rivalled their mothers in the wantonness of their motions and the arts of allurement.\r\n>\r\n> — Yuri Lisyansky in his memoirs\r\n\r\nAdam Johann von Krusenstern in his book about the same expedition as Yuri's, reports that a father brought a 10-12-year-old girl on his ship, and she had sex with the crew. According to the book of Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu and Étienne Marchand, 8-year-old girls had sex and performed other sexual acts in public."},{"id":1573474015,"layout":"blog\r","title":"Justed learned to fly!\r","date":"2019-11-11 11:06:55 -0100","thumbnail":"/images/uploads/img_20211207_161450.jpg\r","content":"# Physical practice\r\n\r\nKiteboarding is seen as a mid to high intensity exercise, but freeriding can be a low intensity practice like walking, and is usually done in long sessions of up to 2–3 hours. It is amenable to almost all ages, at least from teenagers up to 70 years old or more.[58] It can be seen as a supplement or a substitute for other fitness practices.\r\n\r\n### Safety\r\nPower kites are powerful enough to pull the rider like a boat in wakeboarding and to lift their users to diving heights. An uncontrolled kite can be dangerous, especially in environments with contudent obstacles. A rider can lose control from falling or from sudden wind gusts, which can occur in the presence of strong winds from squalls or storms (\"collard\").\r\n\r\nIt is possible to be seriously injured after being lofted, dragged, carried off, blown downwind or dashed, resulting in a collision with hard objects including sand, buildings, terrain or power lines or even by hitting the water surface with sufficient speed or height (\"kitemare\", a portmanteau of kite and nightmare). Adequate quality professional kiteboarding training, careful development of experience and consistent use of good judgement and safety gear should result in fewer problems in kiteboarding."}]
