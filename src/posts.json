As the adage states: \"Time flies when you're having fun\".\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that games, toys, and activities perceived as fun are often challenging in some way. When a person is challenged to think consciously, overcome challenge and learn something new, they are more likely to enjoy a new experience and view it as fun. A change from routine activities appears to be at the core of this perception, since people spend much of a typical day engaged in activities that are routine and require limited conscious thinking. Routine information is processed by the brain as a \"chunked pattern\": \"We rarely look at the real world\", according to game designer Raph Koster, \"we instead recognize something we have chunked, and leave it at that. \\[...] One might argue that the essence of much of art is in forcing us to see things as they really are rather than as we assume them to be\". Since it helps people to relax, fun is sometimes regarded as a \"social lubricant\", important in adding \"to one's pleasure in life\" and helping to \"act as a buffer against stress\".\r\n\r\nFor children, fun is strongly related to play and they have great capacity to extract the fun from it in a spontaneous and inventive way. Play \"involves the capacity to have fun – to be able to return, at least for a little while, to never-never land and enjoy it."},{"id":1643069668,"layout":"blog\r","title":"A post on happiness\r","date":"2022-01-24 23:14:28 -0100","thumbnail":"/images/uploads/img_20220124_182725.jpg\r","content":"## Biological role of seratonine\r\n\r\nSerotonin is involved in numerous physiological processes, including sleep, thermoregulation, learning and memory, pain, (social) behavior, sex, feeding, motor activity, biological rhythms and possibly others. In less complex animals, such as some invertebrates, serotonin regulates feeding and other processes. In plants serotonin synthesis seems to be associated with stress signals.\r\n\r\n### Cellular effects\\[edit]\r\n\r\nSerotonin primarily acts through its receptors and its effects depend on which cells and tissues express these receptors (see below).\r\n\r\n#### Receptors\\[edit]\r\n\r\nMain article: 5-HT receptor\r\n\r\nThe 5-HT receptors, the receptors for serotonin, are located on the cell membrane of nerve cells and other cell types in animals, and mediate the effects of serotonin as the endogenous ligand and of a broad range of pharmaceutical and psychedelic drugs.

The English statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher outlined why this is so in what has come to be known as Fisher's principle. This essentially says the following:\r\n\r\n* 1. Suppose male births are less common than female.\r\n  2. A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.\r\n  3. Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.\r\n  4. Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.\r\n  5. As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.\r\n  6. The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio."},{"id":1640189838,"layout":"blog\r","title":"Časovno uvščen\r","date":"2021-12-22 15:17:18 -0100","thumbnail":"/images/uploads/img_20220124_182317.jpg\r","content":"# Sex in French Polinesya\r\n\r\nThe Islands have been noted for their sexual culture. Many sexual activities seen as taboo in western cultures were viewed as appropriate by the native culture. Contact with Western societies has changed many of these customs, so research into their pre-Western social history has to be done by reading antique writings.\r\n\r\nChildren slept in the same room as their parents and were able to witness their parents while they had sex. Intercourse simulation became real penetration as soon as boys were physically able. Adults found simulation of sex by children to be funny. As children approached 11 attitudes shifted toward girls. Premarital sex was not encouraged but was allowed in general, restrictions on adolescent sexuality were incest, exogamy regulations, and firstborn daughters of high-ranking lineage. After their firstborn child, high-ranking women were permitted extramarital affairs.\r\n\r\n> The next day, as soon as it was light, we were surrounded by a still greater multitude of these people. There were now a hundred females at least; and they practised all the arts of lewd expression and gesture, to gain admission on board. It was with difficulty I could get my crew to obey the orders I had given on this subject. Amongst these females were some not more than ten years of age. But youth, it seems, is here no test of innocence; these infants, as I may call them, rivalled their mothers in the wantonness of their motions and the arts of allurement.\r\n>\r\n> — Yuri Lisyansky in his memoirs\r\n\r\nAdam Johann von Krusenstern in his book about the same expedition as Yuri's, reports that a father brought a 10-12-year-old girl on his ship, and she had sex with the crew.

Programmers also conceive, design, and test logical structures for solving problems by computer. Many technical innovations in programming — advanced computing technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming tools — have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization.\r\n\r\nProgrammers work in many settings, including corporate information technology (IT) departments, big software companies, small service firms and government entities of all sizes. Many professional programmers also work for consulting companies at client sites as contractors. Licensing is not typically required to work as a programmer, although professional certifications are commonly held by programmers. Programming is widely considered a profession (although some[*who?*] authorities disagree on the grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count as a profession).\r\n\r\nProgrammers' work varies widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs. For example, the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in a few hours. More complex ones may require more than a year of work, while others are never considered 'complete' but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several programmers work together as a team under a senior programmer's supervision.\r\n\r\nProgrammers write programs according to the specifications determined primarily by more senior programmers or systems analysts. After the design process is complete, it is the job of the programmer to convert that design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow. The programmer codes these instructions in one of many programming languages. Different programming languages are used depending on the purpose of the program. COBOL, for example, is commonly used for business applications that typically run on mainframe and midrange computers, whereas Fortran is used in science and engineering. C++ and Python are widely used for both scientific and business applications. Java, C#, JavaScript and PHP are popular programming languages for Web and business applications. Programmers generally know more than one programming language and, because many languages are similar, they often can learn new languages relatively easily. In practice, programmers often are referred to by the language they know, e.g. as *Java programmers*, or by the type of function they perform or the environment in which they work: for example, *database programmers*, *mainframe programmers*, or web developers.\r\n\r\nWhen making changes to the source code that defines the program, programmers need to make other programmers aware of the task that the routine is to perform. They do this by writing software documentation and by inserting comments in the source code so that others can understand the program more easily. To save time, programmers often use libraries of basic code that can be modified or customized for a specific application. This approach yields more reliable and consistent programs and increases programmers' productivity by eliminating some routine steps."},{"id":1573474015,"layout":"blog\r","title":"Justed learned to fly!\r","date":"2019-11-11 11:06:55 -0100","thumbnail":"/images/uploads/img_20211207_161450.jpg\r","content":"# Physical practice\r\n\r\nKiteboarding is seen as a mid to high intensity exercise, but freeriding can be a low intensity practice like walking, and is usually done in long sessions of up to 2–3 hours. It is amenable to almost all ages, at least from teenagers up to 70 years old or more.[58] It can be seen as a supplement or a substitute for other fitness practices.\r\n\r\n### Safety\r\nPower kites are powerful enough to pull the rider like a boat in wakeboarding and to lift their users to diving heights. An uncontrolled kite can be dangerous, especially in environments with contudent obstacles. A rider can lose control from falling or from sudden wind gusts, which can occur in the presence of strong winds from squalls or storms (\"collard\").\r\n\r\nIt is possible to be seriously injured after being lofted, dragged, carried off, blown downwind or dashed, resulting in a collision with hard objects including sand, buildings, terrain or power lines or even by hitting the water surface with sufficient speed or height (\"kitemare\", a portmanteau of kite and nightmare). Adequate quality professional kiteboarding training, careful development of experience and consistent use of good judgement and safety gear should result in fewer problems in kiteboarding."}]
