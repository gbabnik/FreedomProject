Programmers also conceive, design, and test logical structures for solving problems by computer. Many technical innovations in programming — advanced computing technologies and sophisticated new languages and programming tools — have redefined the role of a programmer and elevated much of the programming work done today. Job titles and descriptions may vary, depending on the organization.\r\n\r\nProgrammers work in many settings, including corporate information technology (IT) departments, big software companies, small service firms and government entities of all sizes. Many professional programmers also work for consulting companies at client sites as contractors. Licensing is not typically required to work as a programmer, although professional certifications are commonly held by programmers. Programming is widely considered a profession (although some[*who?*] authorities disagree on the grounds that only careers with legal licensing requirements count as a profession).\r\n\r\nProgrammers' work varies widely depending on the type of business for which they are writing programs. For example, the instructions involved in updating financial records are very different from those required to duplicate conditions on an aircraft for pilots training in a flight simulator. Simple programs can be written in a few hours. More complex ones may require more than a year of work, while others are never considered 'complete' but rather are continuously improved as long as they stay in use. In most cases, several programmers work together as a team under a senior programmer's supervision.\r\n\r\nProgrammers write programs according to the specifications determined primarily by more senior programmers or systems analysts. After the design process is complete, it is the job of the programmer to convert that design into a logical series of instructions that the computer can follow. The programmer codes these instructions in one of many programming languages. Different programming languages are used depending on the purpose of the program. COBOL, for example, is commonly used for business applications that typically run on mainframe and midrange computers, whereas Fortran is used in science and engineering. C++ and Python are widely used for both scientific and business applications. Java, C#, JavaScript and PHP are popular programming languages for Web and business applications. Programmers generally know more than one programming language and, because many languages are similar, they often can learn new languages relatively easily. In practice, programmers often are referred to by the language they know, e.g. as *Java programmers*, or by the type of function they perform or the environment in which they work: for example, *database programmers*, *mainframe programmers*, or web developers.\r\n\r\nWhen making changes to the source code that defines the program, programmers need to make other programmers aware of the task that the routine is to perform. They do this by writing software documentation and by inserting comments in the source code so that others can understand the program more easily. To save time, programmers often use libraries of basic code that can be modified or customized for a specific application. This approach yields more reliable and consistent programs and increases programmers' productivity by eliminating some routine steps."},{"id":1643112377,"layout":"blog\r","title":"Just have fun!\r","date":"2022-01-25 11:06:17 -0100","thumbnail":"/images/uploads/img_20211207_161450.jpg\r","content":"# Psychology of fun\r\n\r\nAccording to Johan Huizinga, fun is \"an absolutely primary category of life, familiar to everybody at a glance right down to the animal level.\" Psychological studies reveal both the importance of fun and its effect on the perception of time, which is sometimes said to be shortened when one is having fun. As the adage states: \"Time flies when you're having fun\".\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that games, toys, and activities perceived as fun are often challenging in some way. When a person is challenged to think consciously, overcome challenge and learn something new, they are more likely to enjoy a new experience and view it as fun. A change from routine activities appears to be at the core of this perception, since people spend much of a typical day engaged in activities that are routine and require limited conscious thinking. Routine information is processed by the brain as a \"chunked pattern\": \"We rarely look at the real world\", according to game designer Raph Koster, \"we instead recognize something we have chunked, and leave it at that. \\[...] One might argue that the essence of much of art is in forcing us to see things as they really are rather than as we assume them to be\". Since it helps people to relax, fun is sometimes regarded as a \"social lubricant\", important in adding \"to one's pleasure in life\" and helping to \"act as a buffer against stress\".\r\n\r\nFor children, fun is strongly related to play and they have great capacity to extract the fun from it in a spontaneous and inventive way. Play \"involves the capacity to have fun – to be able to return, at least for a little while, to never-never land and enjoy it."},{"id":1643069668,"layout":"blog\r","title":"A post on happiness\r","date":"2022-01-24 23:14:28 -0100","thumbnail":"/images/uploads/img_20220124_182725.jpg\r","content":"## Biological role of seratonine\r\n\r\nSerotonin is involved in numerous physiological processes, including sleep, thermoregulation, learning and memory, pain, (social) behavior, sex, feeding, motor activity, biological rhythms and possibly others. In less complex animals, such as some invertebrates, serotonin regulates feeding and other processes. In plants serotonin synthesis seems to be associated with stress signals.\r\n\r\n### Cellular effects\\[edit]\r\n\r\nSerotonin primarily acts through its receptors and its effects depend on which cells and tissues express these receptors (see below).\r\n\r\n#### Receptors\\[edit]\r\n\r\nMain article: 5-HT receptor\r\n\r\nThe 5-HT receptors, the receptors for serotonin, are located on the cell membrane of nerve cells and other cell types in animals, and mediate the effects of serotonin as the endogenous ligand and of a broad range of pharmaceutical and psychedelic drugs.

The English statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher outlined why this is so in what has come to be known as Fisher's principle. This essentially says the following:\r\n\r\n* 1. Suppose male births are less common than female.\r\n  2. A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.\r\n  3. Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.\r\n  4. Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.\r\n  5. As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.\r\n  6. The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio."}]
