According to [Johan Huizinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Huizinga "Johan Huizinga"), fun is "an absolutely primary category of life, familiar to everybody at a glance right down to the animal level."[\[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun#cite_note-11) Psychological studies reveal both the importance of fun and its effect on the [perception of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception_of_time "Perception of time"), which is sometimes said to be shortened when one is having fun.[\[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun#cite_note-12)[\[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun#cite_note-13) As the adage states: "Time flies when you're having fun".

It has been suggested that games, toys, and activities perceived as fun are often challenging in some way. When a person is challenged to think consciously, overcome challenge and learn something new, they are more likely to enjoy a new experience and view it as fun. A change from routine activities appears to be at the core of this perception, since people spend much of a typical day engaged in activities that are routine and require limited conscious thinking. Routine information is processed by the brain as a "chunked pattern": "We rarely look at the real world", according to game designer [Raph Koster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raph_Koster "Raph Koster"), "we instead recognize something we have chunked, and leave it at that. \[...] One might argue that the essence of much of art is in forcing us to see things as they really are rather than as we assume them to be".[\[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun#cite_note-14) Since it helps people to relax, fun is sometimes regarded as a "social lubricant", important in adding "to one's pleasure in life" and helping to "act as a buffer against stress".[\[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun#cite_note-Urdang-15)

For children, fun is strongly related to play and they have great capacity to extract the fun from it in a spontaneous and inventive way. Play "involves the capacity to have fun – to be able to return, at least for a little while, to [never-never land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland "Neverland") and enjoy it.
